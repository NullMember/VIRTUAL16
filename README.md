# VIRTUAL16
16-bit virtual microprocessor implemented in MOS6502 assembly, inspired by Steve Wozniak's SWEET16  
If you want to assemble [src/VIRTUAL16.asm](src/VIRTUAL16.asm) file you can use [naken_asm](https://github.com/mikeakohn/naken_asm) or another 6502 assembler.  
For assembling your own VIRTUAL16 code copy contents of [src/VIRTUAL16.cpu](src/VIRTUAL16.cpu) and paste it to [here](https://hlorenzi.github.io/customasm/web/)
